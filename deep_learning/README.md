# Deep Learning Assignments

This directory contains three university assignments completed for the course **Deep Learning for AIE (TU Graz)**.  
Each assignment focuses on a different family of neural network models and includes the corresponding code used to reproduce the results.

## Assignment Overview

### 1. Fully Connected Neural Network — California Housing (Regression)
A feedforward neural network trained on the California Housing dataset to predict median house values.  
Tasks include data preprocessing, feature normalization, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

### 2. Convolutional Neural Network — Fashion-MNIST (Image Classification)
A custom CNN trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.  
The assignment covers architecture exploration, early stopping, parameter counting, kernel visualization, regularization techniques, and data augmentation.

### 3. Generative Pre-trained Transformer — Character-Level GPT
A simplified GPT model implemented using PyTorch primitives.  
The assignment includes implementing causal self-attention, MLP blocks, the GPT forward pass, sampling with temperature, and experimenting with model scaling.
